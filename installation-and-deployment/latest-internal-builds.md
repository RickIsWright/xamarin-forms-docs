# Latest Internal Builds

The Latest Internal Build (LIB) is a bi-weekly distribution of the Telerik UI for Xamarin assemblies, built against the latest development environment. It contains all the newest bug fixes. And it is released on a bi-weekly basis.

The purpose of the the latest internal build is to allow the users to test the latest bug fixes. So, if you have experienced any problem with the current official distributions there is a possibility that the issue has already been addressed in the latest internal build.

>important The LIBs are intended for development only and are not recommended for production purposes as these distributions have not gone through the complete QA process.
